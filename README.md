# PHP Infinite Scroll Multiselect

This project demonstrates the use of [Select2](https://select2.org/) for multiselect dropdowns with infinite scrolling functionality. 

## Demonstration

Designed to efficiently handle large datasets with smooth infinite scrolling. As the user types or scrolls, new data is fetched dynamically, improving performance and usabilityâ€”ideal for large lists such as thousands of features or projects.

## Project

- Select2 multiselect dropdown for features  
- Select2 single select dropdown for projects  
- Infinite scroll for the both.

## MySQL database Configuration 

MySQL database settings are located in `config/_db.php`.

Sample SQL data is available in `insert_random_data.sql`, which populates:
- A multiselect dropdown for **features**
- A single select dropdown for **projects**

## Running the Local Server

To start the server locally, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
php -S localhost:3000 -t public
